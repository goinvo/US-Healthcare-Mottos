### 1. Do No Harm
###### Clinicians and digital services avoid causing harm to patients.

Primum non nocere (First, do no harm): This is a key principle in medical ethics and serves as a reminder to healthcare professionals that their primary responsibility is to avoid causing harm to patients.

### 2. Universal Primary Care
###### You step on US soil, you get care.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/f06db060-e456-449a-a66a-04f32c7df96b" width="300" height="300">

All patients have access to care. Healthcare is universal and a right.

### 3. Fear-Free, Timely Access to Care
###### Readily available, easily accessible, zero distress.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/7b49a38a-07c6-4dce-a885-fc953f8dcf7d" width="300" height="300">

Timely access to care is critical for preventing the worsening of health conditions, reducing the risk of complications, and ensuring optimal outcomes. We also demand a fear-free environment involves fostering open communication, providing clear information, and addressing patient concerns with empathy.

### 4. Patient Information is Private
###### Safeguard the confidentiality of patients' personal and medical information.

All sensitive data related to a patient's health, medical history, treatments, and other personal details remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. It entails implementing strict privacy measures, secure data storage, and controlled access to medical records to prevent breaches and maintain patient trust. 

### 5. Protect Against Criminal Use of Health Data
###### Contribute to a secure and trusted healthcare environment.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/e34ab4ba-0015-4be4-a2af-8574eb3c0c7d" width="300" height="300">

According to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), covered entities and their business associates are responsible for implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI, protecting it from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure for criminal purposes. This includes measures such as data encryption, access controls, security training, and regular risk assessments.

### 6. Patients Make Their Own Decisions
###### Nothing About the Patient, Without the Patient.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/4606d781-8b3a-483d-aec9-3742df81558f" width="300" height="300">

Providers act in the best interest of the patient. Patient information is private (providers have a legal and ethical obligation to maintain the privacy of their patients' information).

### 7. Clear Consent
###### Patients are presented and know the nature, risk, and benefits of the proposed care.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/605f2e14-9fb4-4b50-af1d-12a27e001b5e" width="300" height="300">

We mandate transparent communication of all pertinent medical information to patients, empowering them to make informed decisions about their healthcare. We underscore voluntary agreement free from coercion, necessitate comprehensible presentation of medical details, and require thorough documentation of the consent process. 

### 8. Explainable Medical Costs
###### Costs are known before any service is performed.

<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/ccc53373-3cd0-42c4-bc06-62f29b55ac97" width="300" height="300">

We advocate for transparency and clarity in the pricing of medical services and treatments.Patients should have a easily understandable breakdown of medical costs, encompassing procedures, medications, consultations, and other related expenses. We must allow patients to make informed decisions, avoid "surprises", and participate in discussions about cost-effective treatments.

### 9. Drug Possession is Legal
###### Individuals ARE allowed to possess certain drugs, often for personal use, without facing legal repercussions.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/73e87050-a45c-48eb-a6d7-03d41e13aaf1" width="300" height="300">

This approach recognizes that the criminalization of drug possession can deter individuals from seeking necessary medical assistance and rehabilitation. By decriminalizing drug possession, we aim to shift the focus from punitive measures to a more compassionate and health-oriented approach, enabling individuals struggling with substance use disorders to access treatment, support, and education rather than punishment, fostering a more holistic and humane approach to addressing drug-related issues.

### 10. One Data Schema
###### A core, standard data representation of a patient.

<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/d69951cf-36c3-4b12-aeae-254b38615555" width="300" height="300">

We demand standardizing the structure and format of healthcare data across various systems and platforms. By adopting a uniform data schema, healthcare organizations, providers, and systems can ensure seamless interoperability, accurate data sharing, and improved communication between different entities within the healthcare ecosystem. 


### 11. Patient Data Ownership
###### Patients have the ultimate control and ownership over their personal health data. 

<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/138a3fba-07c4-4d80-b0a8-ecef6bfb6949" width="300" height="300">

Individuals have the right to access, manage, and make decisions regarding the use and sharing of their own health information. Covered entities and their business associates places patients at the center of their healthcare journey, enabling them to grant or withhold consent for the collection, storage, and dissemination of their data.
