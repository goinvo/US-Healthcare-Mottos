### 1. Do No Harm
###### Clinicians and digital services avoid causing harm to patients.

Primum non nocere (First, do no harm): This is a key principle in medical ethics and serves as a reminder to healthcare professionals that their primary responsibility is to avoid causing harm to patients.

### 2. Universal Primary Care
###### You step on US soil, you get care.

All patients have access to care. Healthcare is universal and a right.

### 3. Fear-Free, Timely Access to Care
###### Readily available, easily accessible, zero distress.

Patients might hesitate to seek care due to concerns about diagnoses, treatments, or potential costs. Therefore, timely access to care is critical for preventing the worsening of health conditions, reducing the risk of complications, and ensuring optimal outcomes. We also demand a fear-free environment involves fostering open communication, providing clear information, and addressing patient concerns with empathy. Healthcare providers strive to establish trust and rapport with patients, ensuring that they feel respected, heard, and understood throughout their healthcare journey.

### 4. Patient Information is Private

Focusing on the fundamental importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of patients' personal and medical information, we need to ensure that all sensitive data related to a patient's health, medical history, treatments, and other personal details remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. It entails implementing strict privacy measures, secure data storage, and controlled access to medical records to prevent breaches and maintain patient trust. Respecting the privacy of patient information is not only a legal and ethical responsibility but also essential for preserving patient autonomy, fostering open communication between patients and healthcare providers, and upholding the integrity of the healthcare system.

### 5. Protect Against Criminal Use of Health Data
###### I'm a sub-tag.

We insist on safeguarding sensitive health information from unauthorized access, use, or exploitation for criminal purposes. Robust data security measures to prevent hacking, identity theft, fraud, and other illicit activities involving healthcare data are crucial. We advocate for implementing strong encryption, authentication protocols, and stringent access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals can access and manipulate health-related information. By prioritizing the protection of health data against criminal use, this principle aims to preserve patient privacy, maintain data integrity, and prevent potential harm arising from unauthorized access, contributing to a secure and trusted healthcare environment.

### 6. Patients Make Their Own Decisions
###### Nothing About the Patient, Without the Patient.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/4606d781-8b3a-483d-aec9-3742df81558f" width="300" height="300">

Providers act in the best interest of the patient. Patient information is private (providers have a legal and ethical obligation to maintain the privacy of their patients' information).

### 7. Clear Consent
###### Patients are presented and know the nature, risk, and benefits of the proposed care.
<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/d53239f0-85d2-447c-80e7-f5f44b8595fc" width="300" height="300">

We mandate transparent communication of all pertinent medical information to patients, empowering them to make informed decisions about their healthcare. We underscore voluntary agreement free from coercion, necessitates comprehensible presentation of medical details, and require thorough documentation of the consent process. We also require assessing patients' capacity for decision-making and respecting their autonomy to accept or decline treatments in line with their values and beliefs, thereby fostering trust, shared decision-making, and respect between patients and healthcare providers.

### 8. Explainable Medical Costs
###### Costs are known before any service is performed.

<img src="https://github.com/goinvo/US-Healthcare-Principles/assets/140448888/ccc53373-3cd0-42c4-bc06-62f29b55ac97" width="300" height="300">

We advocate for transparency and clarity in the pricing of medical services and treatments.Patients should have a clear and easily understandable breakdown of medical costs, encompassing procedures, medications, consultations, and other related expenses. We must acknowledge the importance of providing patients with comprehensive information about the financial aspects of their healthcare, allowing them to make informed decisions, avoid "surprises", and participate in discussions about cost-effective treatments, ultimately promoting trust and accountability in the healthcare system.

### 9. Drug Possession is Legal
###### I'm a sub-tag.

Individuals ARE allowed to possess certain drugs, often for personal use, without facing legal repercussions. This approach recognizes that the criminalization of drug possession can deter individuals from seeking necessary medical assistance and rehabilitation. By decriminalizing drug possession, we aim to shift the focus from punitive measures to a more compassionate and health-oriented approach, enabling individuals struggling with substance use disorders to access treatment, support, and education rather than punishment, fostering a more holistic and humane approach to addressing drug-related issues.

### 10. One Data Schema
###### A core, standard data representation of a patient

National data definitions, with rotating governance, drive patient care.
We demand standardizing the structure and format of healthcare data across various systems and platforms. By adopting a uniform data schema, healthcare organizations, providers, and systems can ensure seamless interoperability, accurate data sharing, and improved communication between different entities within the healthcare ecosystem. This standardization enhances the quality of care, reduces errors, facilitates research, and supports more efficient healthcare operations, ultimately benefiting patients and the healthcare industry as a whole.


### 11. Patient Data Ownership
###### Own Your Health Data.

Patients own their health data, and co-own it with providers when created together. Patient data is transportable between AI services. And the pejorative use of patient health data is criminalized.
