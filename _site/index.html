						<h3>1. Do No Harm</h3>
                        <h4>Clinicians and digital services avoid causing harm to patients.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>Primum non nocere (First, do no harm) is a fundamental ethical principle in medical ethics. It encapsulates the ethical obligation of healthcare providers to prioritize patient well-being and refrain from actions that could cause physical, emotional, or psychological harm. </p>
                        <br>
					    <p>Stemming from the Hippocratic Oath, this principle guides medical professionals to make decisions and provide treatments that maximize benefits while minimizing risks and potential adverse effects. It underscores the responsibility to act in the best interest of the patient, maintain competency, and provide accurate information, with the overarching aim of ensuring that the actions and decisions of healthcare providers do not result in harm to the patient's health, safety, or overall quality of life.</p>

						<h3>2. Primary Care For All</h3>
                        <h4>You step on US soil, you get care.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>All patients have access to care. Healthcare is universal and a right. "Everybody in, nobody out." - Right Care Alliance</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> The United States ensures access to basic healthcare services for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status, age, gender, or other demographic factors. The primary goal of universal primary care is to provide a foundational level of healthcare that focuses on prevention, early intervention, and the management of common health issues, thus improving overall population health and reducing healthcare disparities.</p>
                        <br>

						<img src="assets/gifs/3_FearFreeTimelyCare.gif" alt="Healthcare is an imaginary friend that is with you whenever you need them. They take care of you all the time: manage your
                        medication, activities, sleep, and a lot more!">
						<h3>3. Fear-Free Timely Care</h3>
                        <h4>Make healthcare readily available, easily accessible, and zero distress.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>Patients might hesitate to seek care due to concerns about diagnoses, treatments, or potential costs. Therefore, timely access to care is critical for preventing the worsening of health conditions, reducing the risk of complications, and ensuring optimal outcomes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Providers ensure a fear-free environment by fostering open communication, providing clear information, and addressing patient concerns with empathy. Healthcare providers strive to establish trust and rapport with patients, ensuring that they feel respected, heard, and understood throughout their healthcare journey.</p>

						<h3>4. Patient Information Privacy</h3>
                        <h4>Safeguard the confidentiality of patients' personal and medical information.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>All sensitive data related to a patient's health, medical history, treatments, and other personal details remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This principle entails implementing strict privacy measures, secure data storage, and controlled access to medical records to prevent breaches and maintain patient trust. Respecting the privacy of patient information is not only a legal and ethical responsibility but also essential for preserving patient autonomy, fostering open communication between patients and healthcare providers, and upholding the integrity of the healthcare system.</p>

						<h3>5. No Health Data Misuse</h3>
                        <h4>Prevent illicit use of health data for criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft, blackmail, and other malicious intents.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>According to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), covered entities and their business associates are responsible for protecting against the criminal use of health data. Covered entities include healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Business associates are individuals or entities that perform services on behalf of covered entities and involve the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>These entities are required to implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI, protecting it from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure for criminal purposes. This includes measures such as data encryption, access controls, security training, and regular risk assessments. </p>

                        choice in her best interest.">
						<h3>6. Patients Make Their Own Decisions</h3>
                        <h4>Patients are the ultimate decision makers, and providers act in the best interest of the patient.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>This principle reflects the concept of patient autonomy and the fundamental right of individuals to make informed choices about their own medical care. Health providers place the patient at the center of decision-making regarding their health, medical treatments, and interventions. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This principle also emphasizes that patients have the right to make decisions based on their values, preferences, and informed understanding of their medical condition and treatment options. </p>

						<h3>7. Clear Consent</h3>
                        <h4>Patients are presented and understand the nature, risks, and benefits of the proposed care.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>This principle underscores voluntary agreement free from coercion, necessitates comprehensible presentation of medical details, and requires thorough documentation of the consent process. Transparent communication of all pertinent medical information to patients empowers them to make informed decisions about their healthcare.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The consensual process also includes assessing patients' capacity for decision-making and respecting their autonomy to accept or decline treatments in line with their values and beliefs, thereby fostering trust, shared decision-making, and respect between patients and healthcare providers.</p>

						<h3>8. Understandable Medical Costs</h3>
                        <h4>Patients are provided with a patient data receipt, and costs are known before any service is performed.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>This principle emphasizes that patients should have a clear and easily understandable breakdown of medical costs, encompassing procedures, medications, consultations, and other related expenses.   </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Covered entities must acknowledge the importance of providing patients with comprehensive receipt about the financial aspects of their healthcare, allowing them to make informed decisions, avoid surprises, and participate in discussions about cost-effective treatments, ultimately promoting trust and accountability in the healthcare system.</p>

						<img src="assets/gifs/9_DecriminalizeDrugPossessionAndAddictionB.gif" alt="A woman is sitting in her kitchen with her cat, weed, shrooms, and cocaine.">
						<h3>9. Decriminalized Drug Possession</h3>
                        <h4>Cultivate a non- judgemental attitude toward substance abuse, and create a safe environment for rehabilitation. </h4>
                        <br>
						<p>This principle encompasses the perspective that individuals are allowed to possess certain drugs, often for personal use, without facing legal repercussions. This approach recognizes that the criminalization of drug possession can deter individuals from seeking necessary medical assistance and rehabilitation. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>By decriminalizing drug possession, this principle aims to shift the focus from punitive measures to a more compassionate and health-oriented approach, enabling individuals struggling with substance use disorders to access treatment, support, and education rather than punishment, fostering a more holistic and humane approach to addressing drug-related issues.</p>

						<h3>10. One Data Schema</h3>

                        <br>
						<p>National data definitions, with rotating governance, drive patient care. Policy makers standardize the structure and format of healthcare data across various systems and platforms. By adopting a uniform data schema, healthcare organizations, providers, and systems can ensure seamless interoperability, accurate data sharing, and improved communication between different entities within the healthcare ecosystem. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This standardization enhances the quality of care, reduces errors, facilitates research, and supports more efficient healthcare operations, ultimately benefiting patients and the healthcare industry as a whole.</p>

						<h3>11. Patient Data Ownership</h3>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Patients have the ultimate control and ownership over their personal health data.</h4>
                        <br>
						<p>Individuals have the right to access, manage, and make decisions regarding the use and sharing of their own health information. Covered entities and their business associates place patients at the center of their healthcare journey, enabling them to grant or withhold consent for the collection, storage, and dissemination of their data.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This principle aligns with the notion that patients should be active participants in their care and have the authority to determine how their health information is utilized, while also recognizing the responsibility of healthcare providers to protect and secure this data in accordance with legal and ethical standards.</p>
